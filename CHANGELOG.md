# Changelog

All notable changes to content-pipeline are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project uses
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The `/ship`
release step (Stage 7) pulls the section for a tag `vX.Y.Z` out of this file as
the GitHub Release notes, so this changelog is the single source of truth for
"what changed".

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/ziyilam3999/content-pipeline/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (2026-06-08)

Initial import. The first six build stages (config, inputs, copy, image, audio,
video) were built test-first and compose end-to-end as one project.

### Features

- **config**: settings single-source-of-truth (aspect ratios, caption band, providers).
- **inputs**: ContentSpec adapter — turns a launch spec into structured facts with scope guards.
- **copy**: factual social copy generator + a number/claim verifier guardrail.
- **image**: deterministic result-card layout (generative art optional, off by default).
- **audio**: voiceover spec — paid provider primary, free provider fallback, real clip length.
- **video**: even-split captions (phone-friendly) + render specs for three aspect ratios with a caption safe-band.

### Notes

- 9 test suites / 87 tests, all green.
- Publish (P5) and the weekly schedule (P6) are not in this import yet.
